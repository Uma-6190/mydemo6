PULL Request
If you make a change in a repository, GIT PULL can allow others to view the changes. It is used to acknowledge the change 
that you've made to the repository that you're working on. Or also called a target repository.

The simple command to PULL from a branch is:

git pull 'remote_name' 'branch_name'.

The git pull command is a combination of git fetch which fetches the recent commits in the local repository and git merge,
which will merge the branch from a remote to a local branch also 'remote_name' is the repository name and 'branch_name' 
is the name of the specific branch.
